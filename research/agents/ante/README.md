# Ante

> Rust-built, self-contained terminal coding agent by Antigma Labs — designed around self-organizing multi-agent intelligence with lock-free scheduling and full offline capability.

## Overview

**Ante** is an in-terminal coding agent built from scratch in Rust by **Antigma Labs**. Unlike most AI coding tools that layer on top of existing agent frameworks or scripting runtimes, Ante is a ground-up, first-principles implementation — its own runtime, its own scheduler, its own orchestration layer. The result is a fast, self-contained binary with no external framework dependencies.

Antigma Labs' mission is *"building substrate for self-organizing intelligence."* The company name is a play on "anti-Enigma," inspired by Alan Turing's codebreaking work at Bletchley Park. Their core philosophy treats agents as teammates and the user as just another agent in the system — not a privileged operator issuing commands, but a peer collaborator. This worldview extends to broader beliefs around individual AI sovereignty: Antigma frames personal AI tooling as a fundamental right, analogous to "the right to bear arms" in the AI era.

Ante sits in a distinctive corner of the AI coding agent landscape. Where tools like Claude Code and Codex prioritize cloud-connected, single-model agentic loops, Ante emphasizes **offline-first operation**, **multi-agent orchestration**, and **Rust-level performance guarantees**. It can run entirely self-contained with local models — no cloud dependency required — or connect to cloud LLM providers when available. A meta-agent layer orchestrates multiple sub-agents, allowing complex tasks to be decomposed and parallelized across a lock-free scheduling runtime.

### What Makes Ante Special

1. **Rust From Scratch**: Not a wrapper around Python or Node.js agent frameworks. Ante is written entirely in Rust, giving it memory safety, zero-cost abstractions, and a lock-free concurrency model purpose-built for multi-agent orchestration.

2. **Self-Organizing Multi-Agent Architecture**: A meta-agent orchestrates dynamically spawned sub-agents. Tasks are decomposed and distributed, with the user treated as a peer agent rather than a privileged controller.

3. **Offline-First Design**: Ante is fully self-contained and can operate without any cloud dependency. Paired with Antigma's own inference stack (see `nanochat-rs`), it can run local models entirely on-device.

4. **Lock-Free Scheduling**: The Rust runtime uses lock-free data structures for agent scheduling and orchestration, avoiding the mutex contention that plagues thread-based agent systems.

5. **Own Inference Stack**: Antigma Labs builds their own components — their `nanochat-rs` project is a tiny GPT-style cognitive core in pure Rust built on HuggingFace Candle, and `mcp-sdk` is a minimalistic Rust MCP implementation. They don't just consume the ecosystem; they build it.

6. **Benchmark Integrity Advocacy**: Ante was notably used as the investigative tool to write a forensic analysis exposing benchmark manipulation on Terminal-Bench 2.0 — a 13-minute deep-dive blog post titled *"How to Achieve #1 on Terminal Bench (and Why We Can't Have Nice Things)."*
