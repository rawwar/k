# Aider

> Pioneering AI pair programming tool that lets you collaboratively edit code with LLMs directly from the terminal, and home to the most comprehensive code-editing model benchmark.

## Overview

**Aider** is an open-source, terminal-based AI pair programming tool created by **Paul Gauthier** ([@paul-gauthier](https://github.com/paul-gauthier)). First released in mid-2023, it rapidly became one of the most influential tools in the AI-assisted coding space, accumulating 30k+ GitHub stars, 5.7M+ pip installs, and processing ~15B tokens per week across its user base.

Aider occupies a distinctive position in the AI coding landscape. It is **not** a fully autonomous agent like Claude Code or Devin — it doesn't browse the web, spawn sub-processes, or orchestrate multi-step plans independently. Instead, it is a **deeply interactive pair programmer**: the human stays in the loop, directing the conversation, adding files to context, and approving changes. This human-in-the-loop design philosophy makes it more of a power tool than an autonomous agent.

Despite this, Aider has been profoundly influential on the entire category. Its innovations — particularly the **edit format system**, **repo-map**, **architect mode**, and the **benchmarking leaderboard** — have shaped how the entire industry thinks about LLM code editing.

### What Makes Aider Special

1. **Edit Format Innovation**: Aider pioneered multiple strategies for getting LLMs to reliably edit files — whole-file replacement, search/replace blocks, unified diffs, and the architect/editor split. Each format is tuned to different model strengths.

2. **Repo-Map**: A tree-sitter-powered, graph-ranked summary of the entire codebase that gives the LLM structural awareness without consuming the full context window.

3. **Architect Mode**: A dual-model approach where a reasoning model plans changes and a code-editing model applies them — achieving SOTA benchmark results.

4. **The Leaderboard**: Aider maintains the most comprehensive public benchmark for code-editing LLM performance, testing 70+ model configurations across 225 Exercism exercises. This has become a de facto industry reference.

5. **Git-Native Workflow**: Every AI edit is automatically committed with a descriptive message, making undo trivial and change review natural.
